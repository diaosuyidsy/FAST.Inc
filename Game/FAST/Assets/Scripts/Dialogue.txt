“Rise and shine, let’s play a game. You're probably wondering where you are. I'll tell you where you might be. You might be in the place that you die in. Now I see you as a strange mix of someone angry, terrified, confused. But mostly just pathetic. So, are you going to die here today, or do something about it?
Listen very carefully cuz I won’t repeat. You need to keep moving forward to get out. There will be some obstacles, fun obstacles along the way, just, you know, find a way to pass through. Don’t worry, there will be hints provided. I’m a reasonable person. 
But the hints……. this is the fun part; the hints are in somewhere else. Since you cannot transmit yourself to get the hint, hey, how about transmit ideas. See the walkie talkie in your hand? Congratulations, you are not alone. Your pathetic buddy gonna give you the hints. If they dumb, you doomed. 
Oh, one more thing, each obstacle has a timer, it will be activated at the moment you touch the obstacle. I would highly recommend you finish in time, or……you may not like the next part. Let’s just assume a machete will come up from nowhere or a bomb, I don’t know, honestly, I kinda forgot what I put out there. 
So……that’s it. Let’s play
